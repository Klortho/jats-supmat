<!--                    SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL PRESERVATION         -->
<!--                    This records a commitment from a publisher 
                        or archive to carry the supplemental 
                        material forward. Used to help determine
                        the likelihood that the material will be 
                        accessible in the future.
                        Remarks: Preservation is a larger
                        issue than promising format migration; this
                        could include a recomputation, media refresh, 
                        emulation, or other preservation strategies.

<!--                    Preservation level promised by the
                        publisher or archive. The preservation level 
                        can be different for each format type, and 
                        different for each object within a format.
                        Remarks: There is no established list of
                        types or values at this time. Each publisher
                        or archive must establish what they mean by
                        level of preservation. For example, the US
                        National Library of Medicine uses what they
                        call "permanence levels":
                         - "Permanent: Unchanging Content"
