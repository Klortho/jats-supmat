                        part of the modular Journal Archiving and

                        declared in the DTD-specific module of modules.
                           Since this module declares but does not
                        invoke modules, this DTD invokes any modules
                        it uses by referencing the external
                        Parameter Entities defined in the Module of

                        as all the lists or the MathML elements) this
                        module defines the external Parameter Entity
                        for the module(s) that contains the MathML
                        declarations and the DTD references that
